Colin Nicholson
06/2018
Uses Python 3, tested on Python 3.4.3

libraries to install:

pip install -r requirements.txt


See image files in this directory (example1.png, example2.png) for examples on how this code morphs Facebook's main page.

Two parameters can be altered in run.py: url (site to morph) and noise level (how much randomness we add).  Screenshots of the morphed sites appear in the output folder.
