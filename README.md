Uses Python 2.7

libraries to install:

pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup
pip install selenium

See image files in this directory (example1.png, example2.png) for examples on how this code morphs Facebook's main page.

Two parameters can be altered in run.py: url (site to morph) and noise level (how much randomness we add).  Screenshots of the morphed sites appear in the output folder.
